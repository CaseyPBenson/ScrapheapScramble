mix of market row and fixed market - a number of 'rows' containing piles of fixed market cards; your bot can only buy from 1 row at a time
choose cards, then shuffle them all up and deal out 'scrap' piles
actions for marketbot:
-Move up
-buy x (recover x cards from scrap pile - higher isn't always better)
-trash
--Maybe trashing is also how you get gold ('fuel')? incentive to buy cards you don't need cause you'll need to burn them for literal gas
--trashing adds to your score pile. some cards are worth -vp when trashed but have high fuel values
